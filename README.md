# PhD Project Code

Week of 17/10/2023

- Initial look at 1D Generative Models
- Got model quickly trained on random data to check how data is input and output from model. (Small number of training steps, just as a test). Successfully takes in 1D vectors and outputs 1D vectors in the same format.
- Got some code put together to take features from Ember (Byte Histogram) and convert them into tensors. Issues getting data to be read in by model (Work-in-progress)
